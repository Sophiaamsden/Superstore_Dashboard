# Objective

The goal of this project is to help business users quickly understand:

- How sales and profitability vary across time and geography

- Which product categories and customer segments drive performance

- Trends that support decision-making for inventory, marketing, or revenue growth

# Dashboard Highlights

The dashboard includes:

- Sales and Profit Trends Over Time — visual analysis of revenue and profit trajectory

- Regional Performance Analysis — comparison of sales/profit by region and state

- Product Category Breakdown — performance across product categories and sub-categories

- Interactive Filters — dynamic exploration by region, category, and time period

These visual components support real business questions such as identifying top-performing regions or categories and spotting areas for improvement.

## Key Insights
- A small number of product sub-categories contribute disproportionately to total profit.
  
- Some regions generate high sales volume but lower profit margins.
  
- Profitability varies significantly across product categories, highlighting areas for potential improvement.

# Tools & Data
- Tableau Public — dashboard authoring and sharing

- Superstore Dataset — publicly available retail sales dataset from Kaggle
